##Description

The basic idea is to create a website to explore the completed or working projects in our campus. 
 Group of students working on differ domains can gather under the same roof through this website and contribute to their interested domain projects.  
 If some group requires a specific skill candidate then they can post it on their respective page and the student with required skill can directly 
 contact that group so in this way the opportunities can be created for students to show their skills.
 Also if college faculty need group member of the same domain to work for his or her project so they can directly display it on site. It will also 
increase participation of students in practical projects of what we are learning. Also it will help students to get the feedback on their project 
idea from fellow students and mentors.
It will also include the previous achievement of students like for example , there can be some students who have taken part in GSOC(google summer of code)
so the information of their contribution in open source , free software or technology can be made available online with their experience 
(how they started , what sources they used , how they cracked GSOC ,what kind of difficulties they face etc.) This website will also help students to get guidance 
from mentors in their project like how to proceed ,what knowledge is needed ,what skillsets are required if you're working on specific idea
